# GRID-Arcade

This is the **GRID** (**G**aming **R**etro **I**nteractive **D**evice), my fun hobby project to create a custom arcade box.

## Components
The display is a [32x32 RGB LED matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1484) connected with an [Adafruit Metro M0 (SAMD21)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505) equipped with a [Adafruit RGB Matrix Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2601). The unit is controlled by a PS2 Joystick hooked up to the Metro.

Everything is housed in a custom unit built in collaboration with my friend Herman Tabunganua.

## Software
The GRID arcade can be programmed with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
