            <p>This is the <strong>GRID</strong> (<strong>G</strong>aming <strong>R</strong>etro

            <h2 id="why-i-did-it">Why I did it</h2>
            <p>I needed to consolidate my two programs I had built for the Adafruit Metro M0 and RGB matrix (<a
                    href="https://github.com/bryanluu/a-maze-ing-race"><em>A-Maze-ing Race</em></a> and <a
                    href="https://github.com/bryanluu/boids"><em>Boids</em></a>), besides, the old enclosure was falling
                apart.</p>
            <img src="images/old_amr.jpeg" alt="Alt Text" width="250">
            <p>This new project would allow players to select between the two
                programs, keep the electronics more stable, and be an exercise in skill
                development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>
            <p>I started with the build. I collaborated with my friend Herman to
                collect materials, design the enclosure, and assemble the structure. The
                whole process took place over a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p>Once the enclosure was finished, we redid the wiring for the Adafruit Metro M0 to the RGB matrix so that
                it
                was more secure.</p>
            <p>Next I began with re-programming Boids and using Notion AI to help me
                implement scene-switching logic for other games. I created a menu and
                cleaned up the code for future re-use. With the help of AI, I made an
                emulation of the display using SDL2 that I could use to debug logic
                before testing with hardware.</p>
            <img src="images/emu_boids.png" alt="Alt Text" width="150">
            <p>Next I implemented a Calibration scene which allowed me to adjust the
                input signals and save them. From there I used the MCU's Flash memory
                and Adafruit's SPI flash library to save/load calibration settings.</p>
            <p>After, I focused on porting A-Maze-ing Race over the new framework. I
                reduced any globals and used best-practice patterns to implement the
                maze game. To ensure the game fit, I used memory efficient data-types
                such as bitsets for game parameters. I enabled high-scores to be
                saved/loaded from Flash memory.</p>
            <p>Finally I added two new games: Conway's <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game
                    of Life</a>, and the classic Snake game.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
            <p>The main challenge I encountered was learning when and how to use AI
                tools for coding C++. I learned that the tools were not accurate for
                certain kinds of issues and this trained me to be more skeptical in its
                results. The best use for it was learning new patterns and ways to
                implement code that other developers found effective. It was also
                helpful in implementing tedious code, e.g. the bit pattern for the GRID
                logo.</p>
            <p>
                Another challenge was implementing timing parity between the emulation
                and hardware. For instance, the Boids program ran slower (~16 FPS) on
                the hardware, so I had to develop timing classes for the emulation to
                run identically as hardware.</p>
